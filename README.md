## Q&A


#### Why is the project using Elysia?

Elysia is a backend framework that is built on top of the bun runtime. It provides a set of tools and conventions that make it easier to build backend applications.

#### Why is the project using the bun runtime?

Bun is designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js

The bun runtime is a lightweight runtime that is optimized for building backend applications. It is also the recommended runtime for [Elysia](https://elysia.gitbook.io/docs/).

As stated in the [bun documentation](https://bunjs.dev/docs/introduction/what-is-bun),
Bun is a new JavaScript runtime built from scratch to serve the modern JavaScript ecosystem.

We also benefit from the performance boost that comes with using the bun runtime. (Read [Benchmark Node.js vs Deno vs Bun using Redis](https://medium.com/deno-the-complete-reference/node-js-vs-deno-vs-bun-who-works-fastest-with-redis-cache-485263e3d9cc))

#### Why does the project use the SRC Architecture?

The SRC Architecture is a proven architectural pattern that is used by many popular backend frameworks, such as [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), [AdonisJS](https://adonisjs.com/), and [FeathersJS](https://feathersjs.com/). It is also the recommended architecture for [Elysia](https://elysia.gitbook.io/docs/).


This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.11. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

## Service-Route-Controller (SRC) Architecture

### Description

The **Service-Route-Controller (SRC) Architecture** is an architectural pattern used for structuring backend applications. It provides a clear separation of responsibilities, making it easier to organize and maintain code. The architecture consists of three main components:

- **Service**: Responsible for handling business logic and interactions with databases or other data sources.
- **Route**: Defines API routes and endpoints to direct incoming HTTP requests to the appropriate controllers.
- **Controller**: Manages application logic and handles HTTP requests.

### Derived From

The SRC Architecture draws inspiration from the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern, adapting it to the context of backend development. While not a strict implementation of MVC, it embraces the principles of separation of concerns and modularity, facilitating the development of scalable and maintainable backend applications.
